## Discovered During Work
- Ensure all async React tests use `findBy*`/`waitFor` for reliability
- Consider standardizing fetch mocking patterns across all tests
- Add troubleshooting notes for async UI and fetch mocks to README.md

## TODO
- Implement actual backend integration for authentication
- Add persistent user profiles with preferences
- Create additional charts and visualizations for climbing statistics
- Add social features (share ascents, follow other climbers)
- Integrate with actual gym databases via API
- Add route/boulder difficulty distribution charts
- Add location-based features (gym check-ins, nearby climbs)
- Implement dark mode and additional accessibility features
- Add support for uploading climb photos
- Create mobile-optimized view for logging ascents at the wall
- Performance optimizations for large ascent histories

## Refactoring Opportunities
- Centralize async logic into service layer or custom hooks
- Implement unified error handling/notification system
- Create test utility helpers for fetch mocks and async patterns
- Address act() warnings in tests/components
- Consider modularizing forms and validation logic
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect for async operations
